This capability enables a hierarchical structure of precomputed results, significantly enhancing query performance and data processing efficiency. With nested materialized views, you can build multi-layered data abstractions, creating increasingly complex and specialized views tailored to specific business needs. This layered approach offers several advantages:\nImproved Query Performance: Each level of the nested materialized view hierarchy serves as a cache, allowing queries to quickly access pre-computed data without the need to traverse the underlying base tables. Reduced Computational Load: By offloading the computational work to the materialized view refresh process, you can significantly reduce the runtime and resource utilization of your day-to-day queries. Simplified Data Modeling: Nested materialized views enable you to create a more modular and extensible data model, where each layer represents a specific business concept or use case. Incremental Refreshes: The Redshift materialized views support incremental refreshes, allowing you to update only the changed data within the nested hierarchy, further optimizing the refresh process. Cascading Materialized Views: The Redshift materialized views with CASCADE can help business users to eliminate the need of creating and maintaining their own data pipelines. You can implement nested materialized views using the CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW statement, which allows referencing other materialized views in the definition. Common use cases include:\nModular data transformation pipelines Hierarchical aggregations for progressive analysis Multi-level data validation pipelines Historical data snapshot management Optimized BI reporting with precomputed results Architecture Architectural diagram depicting Amazon Redshift’s nested materialized view structure. Shows multiple base tables (orange) connecting to materialized views (red), with connections to a nested view layer and data sharing table (green). Includes integration points for users and QuickSight visualization.\nBase Table(s): These are the underlying base tables that contain the raw data for your data warehouse. It can be local tables or data sharing tables. Base Materialized View(s): These are the first-level materialized views that are created directly on top of the base tables. These views encapsulate common data transformations and aggregations. This can serve as the base for the nested materialized view and also be accessed by users directly. Nested Materialized View(s): These are the second level (or higher) materialized views that are created based on the base materialized views. The nested materialized view can further aggregate, filter, or transform the data from the base materialized views. Application/Users/BI Reporting: The application or business intelligence (BI) tools interact with the nested materialized views to generate reports and dashboards. The nested views provide a more optimized and precomputed data structure for efficient querying and reporting. Creating and using nested materialized views To demonstrate how nested materialized views work in Amazon Redshift, we’ll use the TPC-DS dataset. We’ll create three queries using the STORE, STORE_SALES, CUSTOMER, and CUSTOMER_ADDRESS tables to simulate data warehouse reports. This example will illustrate how multiple reports can share result sets and how materialized views can improve both resource efficiency and query performance.\nLet’s consider the following queries as dashboard queries:\nSELECT cust.c_customer_id, cust.c_first_name, cust.c_last_name, sales.ss_item_sk, sales.ss_quantity, cust.c_current_addr_sk FROM store_sales sales INNER JOIN customer cust ON sales.ss_customer_sk = cust.c_customer_sk; SELECT cust.c_customer_id, cust.c_first_name, cust.c_last_name, sales.ss_item_sk, sales.ss_quantity, cust.c_current_addr_sk, store.s_store_name FROM store_sales sales INNER JOIN customer cust ON sales.ss_customer_sk = cust.c_customer_sk INNER JOIN store store ON sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk; SELECT cust.c_customer_id, cust.c_first_name, cust.c_last_name, sales.ss_item_sk, sales.ss_quantity, addr.ca_state FROM store_sales sales INNER JOIN customer cust ON sales.ss_customer_sk = cust.c_customer_sk INNER JOIN store store ON sales.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk INNER JOIN customer_address addr ON cust.c_current_addr_sk = addr.ca_address_sk; Notice that the join between STORE_SALES and CUSTOMER tables is present at all 3 queries (dashboards). The second query adds a join with STORE table and the third query is the second one with an extra join with CUSTOMER_ADDRESS table. This pattern is common in business intelligence scenarios. As mentioned earlier, using a materialized view can speed up queries because the result set is stored and ready to be delivered to the user, avoiding reprocessing of the same data. In cases like this, we can use nested materialized views to reuse already processed data.\nWhen transforming our queries into a set of nested materialized views, the result would be as below:\nCREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW StoreSalesCust as SELECT cust.c_customer_id, cust.c_first_name, cust.c_last_name, sales.ss_item_sk, sales.ss_store_sk, sales.ss_quantity, cust.c_current_addr_sk FROM store_sales sales INNER JOIN customer cust ON sales.ss_customer_sk = cust.c_customer_sk; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW StoreSalesCustStore as SELECT storesalescust.c_customer_id, storesalescust.c_first_name, storesalescust.c_last_name, storesalescust.ss_item_sk, storesalescust.ss_quantity, storesalescust.c_current_addr_sk, store.s_store_name FROM StoreSalesCust storesalescust INNER JOIN store store ON storesalescust.ss_store_sk = store.s_store_sk; CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW StoreSalesCustAddress as SELECT storesalescuststore.c_customer_id, storesalescuststore.c_first_name, storesalescuststore.c_last_name, storesalescuststore.ss_item_sk, storesalescuststore.ss_quantity, addr.ca_state FROM StoreSalesCustStore storesalescuststore INNER JOIN customer_address addr ON storesalescuststore.c_current_addr_sk = addr.ca_address_sk; Nested materialized views can improve performance and resource efficiency by reusing initial view results, minimizing redundant joins, and working with smaller result sets. This creates a hierarchical structure where materialized views depend on one another. Due to these dependencies, you must refresh the views in a specific order.\nWith the new option “REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_name CASCADE” you will be able to refresh the entire chain of dependencies for the materialized views you have. Note that in this example we are using the third materialized view, StoreSalesCustAddress, and this will refresh all 3 materialized views because they are dependent on each other.\nIf we use the second materialized view with the CASCADE option, we will refresh only the first and second materialized views, leaving the third unchanged. This may be useful when we need to keep some materialized views with less current data than others.\nThe SVL_MV_REFRESH_STATUS system view reveals the refresh sequence of materialized views. When triggering a cascade refresh on StoreSalesCustAddress, the system follows the dependency chain we established: StoreSalesCust refreshes first, followed by StoreSalesCustStore, and finally StoreSalesCustAddress. This demonstrates how the refresh operation respects the hierarchical structure of our materialized views.\nConsiderations Consider a dependency chain where StoreSalesCust (A) → StoreSalesCustStore (B) → StoreSalesCustAddress (C).\nThe CASCADE refresh behavior works as follows: When refreshing C with CASCADE: A, B, and C will all be refreshed. When refreshing B with CASCADE: Only A and B will be refreshed. When refreshing A with CASCADE: Only A will be refreshed. If you specifically need to refresh A and C but not B, you must perform separate refresh operations without using CASCADE—first refresh A, then refresh C directly. Best Practices for Materialized View Improve the source query: Start with a well-optimized SELECT statement for your materialized view. This is especially important for views that need full rebuilds during each refresh. Plan refresh strategies: When creating materialized views that depend on other materialized views, you cannot use AUTO REFRESH YES. Instead, implement orchestrated refresh mechanisms using Redshift Data API with Amazon EventBridge for scheduling and AWS Step Functions for workflow management. Leverage distribution and sort keys: Properly configure distribution and sort keys on materialized views based on their query patterns to optimize performance. Well-chosen keys improve query speed and reduce I/O operations. Clean up Complete the following steps to clean up your resources:\nDelete the Redshift provisioned replica cluster or the Redshift serverless endpoints created for this exercise or Drop only the Materialized view which you have created for testing Conclusion This post showed how to create nested Amazon Redshift materialized views and refresh the child materialized views using the new REFRESH CASCADE option. You can quickly build and maintain efficient data processing pipelines and seamlessly extend the low latency query execution benefits of materialized views to data analysis.\nIf you’re unfamiliar with materialized views but want to boost your workload performance, Amazon Redshift offers an Automated materialized view (auto-MV) feature. This intelligent system monitors your workload and automatically creates materialized views to enhance overall performance.

Offering code review for free to its potential customers would not be free for Bito, of course, because it would be paying inference costs. To identify a model for its Free Plan, Bito carried out a 2-week evaluation process across a broad range of models, including the high-performing FMs on Amazon Bedrock, as well as OpenAI GPT-4o mini. The Amazon Nova models—fast, cost-effective models that were recently introduced on Amazon Bedrock—were particularly interesting to the team.\nAt the end of its evaluation, Bito determined that Amazon Nova Lite delivered the right mix of performance and cost-effectiveness for its use cases. Its speed provided fast creation of code review summaries. However, cost—a key consideration for Bito’s Free Plan—proved to be the deciding factor. Ultimately, Amazon Nova Lite met Bito’s criteria for speed, cost, and quality. The combination of Amazon Nova Lite and Amazon Bedrock also make it possible for Bito to offer the reliability and security that their customers needed when entrusting Bito with their code. After all, careful control of code is one of Bito’s core promises to its customers. It doesn’t store code or use it for model training. And its products are SOC 2 Type 2-certified to provide data security, processing integrity, privacy, and confidentiality.\nImplementing the right models for different tiers of offerings Bito has now adopted Amazon Bedrock as its standardized platform to explore, add, and run models. Bito uses Amazon Nova Lite as the primary model for its Free Plan, and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet powers its for-pay Teams Plan, all accessed and integrated through the unified Amazon Bedrock API and controls. Amazon Bedrock provides seamless shifting from Amazon Nova Lite to Anthropic’s Sonnet when customers upgrade, with minimal code changes. Bito leaders are quick to point out that Amazon Nova Lite doesn’t just power its Free Plan—it inspired it. Without the very low cost of Amazon Nova Lite, they wouldn’t have been able to offer a free tier of AI Code Review Agent, which they viewed as a strategic move that would enable it to expand its enterprise customer base. This strategy quickly generated results, attracting three times more prospective customers to its Free Plan than anticipated. At the end of the 14-day trial period, a significant number of users convert to the full AI Code Review Agent to access its full array of capabilities.\nEncouraged by the success with AI Code Review Agent, Bito is now using Amazon Nova Lite to power the chat capabilities of its offering for Bito Wingman, its latest AI agentic technology—a full-featured developer assistant in the integrated development environment (IDE) that combines code generation, error handling, architectural advice, and more. Again, the combination of quality and low cost of Amazon Nova Lite made it the right choice for Bito.\nConclusion In this post, we shared how Bito—an innovative startup that offers a growing portfolio of AI-powered developer agents—chose Amazon Nova Lite to power its free tier offering of AI Code Review Agent, its flagship product. Its AI-powered agents are designed specifically to make developers’ lives easier and their work more impactful:\nAmazon Nova Lite enabled Bito to meet one of its core business challenges—attracting enterprise customers. By introducing a free tier, Bito attracted three times more prospective new customers to its generative AI-driven flagship product—AI Code Review Agent. Amazon Nova Lite outperformed other models during rigorous internal testing, providing the right level of performance at the very low cost Bito needed to launch a free tier of AI Code Review Agent. Amazon Bedrock empowers Bito to seamlessly switch between models as needed for each tier of AI Code Review Agent—Amazon Nova Lite for its Free Plan and Anthropic’s Claude 3.7 Sonnet for its for-pay Teams Plan. Amazon Bedrock also provided security and privacy, critical considerations for Bito customers. Bito shows how innovative organizations can use the combination of quality, cost-effectiveness, and speed in Amazon Nova Lite to deliver value to their customers—and to their business. “Our challenge is to push the capabilities of AI to deliver new value to developers, but at a reasonable cost,” shares Amar Goel, co-founder and CEO of Bito. “Amazon Nova Lite gives us the very fast, low-cost model we needed to power the free offering of our AI Code Review Agent—and attract new customers.”\nGet started with Amazon Nova on the Amazon Bedrock console.

Executive Summary The Document QA system is a serverless application designed to revolutionize how users interact with documents. By leveraging AWS Bedrock for Generative AI and RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) technology, the platform allows users to upload PDF/TXT documents and ask natural language questions. The system provides accurate, context-aware answers by retrieving relevant information from the uploaded documents, significantly reducing manual search time and improving information accessibility.\n2. Problem Statement What\u0026rsquo;s the Problem? Traditional document search methods (keyword matching) often fail to capture context or semantic meaning. Manual document review is time-consuming, error-prone, and inefficient, especially for large volumes of text. Users struggle to extract specific insights quickly, leading to productivity bottlenecks.\nThe Solution We propose a Serverless RAG-based Chatbot using AWS Bedrock (Amazon Titan). The solution involves:\nUpload \u0026amp; Processing: Users upload documents to S3; Lambda functions trigger text extraction and embedding generation. Vector Search: Embeddings are stored and queried to find relevant document chunks. Generative AI: AWS Bedrock generates natural language responses based on the retrieved context. Serverless Architecture: Built on AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB for automatic scaling and cost efficiency. Benefits and Return on Investment Efficiency: Reduces document analysis time from hours to seconds. Accuracy: RAG ensures answers are grounded in the provided document, minimizing hallucinations. Cost-Effective: Serverless pay-as-you-go model (estimated \u0026lt; $5/month for low usage). Scalability: Automatically handles varying loads without manual infrastructure management. 3. Solution Architecture The platform employs a modern serverless architecture to ensure scalability, security, and performance.\nAWS Services Used AWS Bedrock: Provides the Foundation Models (Amazon Titan) for embeddings and text generation. AWS Lambda: Serverless compute for handling API requests, document processing, and orchestration. Amazon API Gateway: Manages REST API endpoints for the frontend. Amazon S3: Stores raw uploaded documents and frontend static assets. Amazon DynamoDB: Manages user sessions and chat history. Vector Store: (Implemented via Lambda/Local or dedicated vector DB) Stores document embeddings for semantic search. Component Design Frontend: Hosted on S3 (or Amplify), providing a user-friendly chat interface. API Layer: API Gateway routes requests (/upload, /ask) to Lambda functions. Processing Layer: Lambda handles text extraction, calls Bedrock for embeddings, and performs vector similarity search. AI Layer: AWS Bedrock generates responses using the retrieved context and user query. 4. Technical Implementation Implementation Phases\nPhase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4): Setup AWS environment, Bedrock access, and basic backend logic. Phase 2: API \u0026amp; Security (Weeks 5-7): Develop API Gateway, Lambda functions, and implement CORS/Security. Phase 3: Frontend Development (Weeks 8-11): Build the React/Next.js interface and integrate with APIs. Phase 4: Testing \u0026amp; Deployment (Weeks 12-14): End-to-end testing, optimization, and final deployment. Technical Requirements\nAI Model: Amazon Titan (via Bedrock) for Embeddings and Text Generation. Backend: Node.js/Python on AWS Lambda. Infrastructure as Code: Serverless Framework or AWS CDK. Frontend: React.js / Next.js. 5. Timeline \u0026amp; Milestones Month 1: Architecture Design, AWS Setup, Backend Core (Upload/Embeddings). Month 2: RAG Implementation, Vector Search Logic, API Development. Month 3: Frontend Integration, UI/UX Polish, Testing, and Launch. 6. Budget Estimation Estimated Monthly Costs (Low-Medium Usage)\nAWS Bedrock (Titan): ~$0 (Free Tier / Low cost per 1k tokens) AWS Lambda: ~$0.20 per 1M requests Amazon S3: ~$0.023 per GB Amazon DynamoDB: ~$0.25 per 1M requests Amazon API Gateway: ~$3.50 per 1M requests Total Estimated: \u0026lt; $5.00 / month\n7. Risk Assessment Risk Matrix Hallucinations (AI Errors): Medium Impact, Medium Probability. Cost Overruns: Medium Impact, Low Probability (Serverless). Data Leakage: High Impact, Low Probability. Mitigation Strategies Hallucinations: Strict RAG implementation (grounding answers in context). Cost: Set AWS Budget Alerts and usage quotas. Security: Use Presigned URLs for S3, IAM roles with least privilege. 8. Expected Outcomes Technical Improvements Fully automated document analysis pipeline. Sub-second retrieval latency for vector search. Scalable architecture supporting concurrent users. Long-term Value A reusable RAG framework for future knowledge base applications. Significant productivity gains for users needing quick information retrieval. 9.
