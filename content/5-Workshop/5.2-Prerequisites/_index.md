#### Step 1: Sign up for Amazon QuickSight

1.  Log in to the AWS Management Console.
2.  Search for **QuickSight**.
3.  If you have not signed up yet, you will be prompted to do so.
4.  Choose **Sign up for QuickSight**.
5.  Select the **Enterprise** edition (it offers a free trial).
6.  Follow the on-screen instructions:
    - **Authentication method**: Use IAM federated identity & QuickSight-managed users (default).
    - **Region**: Select **US East (N. Virginia)**.
    - **QuickSight account name**: Enter a unique name.
    - **Notification email**: Enter your email.
    - **Allow access**: You can leave the defaults or uncheck them if we are only uploading a file. For this workshop, we don't strictly need S3 access, but it's good practice to leave S3 checked if you plan to use it later.
7.  Click **Finish**.

#### Step 2: Prepare Sample Data

We will use a simple CSV file for this workshop.

1.  Copy the following data and save it as a file named `sales_data.csv` on your computer.

```csv
