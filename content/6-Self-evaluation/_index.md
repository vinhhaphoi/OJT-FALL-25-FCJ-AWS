During my internship at **AWS | FCAJ** from **08/09/2025** to **12/12/2025**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge acquired in school to a real-world working environment.  
I participated in **Document QA with AWS Bedrock**, through which I improved my skills in **Cloud Computing (AWS), Generative AI, System Architecture, and Full-stack Development**.

In terms of work ethic, I always strived to complete tasks well, complied with workplace regulations, and actively engaged with colleagues to improve work efficiency.
